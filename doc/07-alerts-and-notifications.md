1.  general port statistics
2.  interface property changes / traffic load
    *   in case of interface property changes: the name(s) of the property and the name(s) of the involved interface(s).  
        Ex: 4 change(s): ifOperStatus - GigabitEthernet2/11 GigabitEthernet2/13 GigabitEthernet2/31 GigabitEthernet2/32
    *   in case of traffic load(s) reaching the thresholds: the severity(ies) of the load, the threshold reached, and the name(s) of the concerned interface(s)  
        Ex: 1 warning load(s) (>2%): Vlan1, 3 critical load(s) (>4%): GigabitEthernet2/25 GigabitEthernet2/33 GigabitEthernet2/42

Real time alerting

You can keep an eye on your monitoring system via various nagios addons. 2 famous ones are nagioschecker (firefox extension) and nagstamon (floating bar on desktop).

Hereunder is an exemple of alert concerning check\_interface\_table\_v3t on nagstamon: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/600025/232099742-589eaca9-8554-4b9e-ae3d-e6137f4b6af6.png)
